## Change non async code to async

Using coroutines and the `async` syntax can make it easier to write asynchronous code,
which is code that can perform multiple tasks concurrently without blocking the execution of
other code. Asynchronous code is useful for applications that need to handle many concurrent
connections or perform I/O-bound operations.

## Challenge

The event/ticket api application is a great example of how async can be used. For this challenge
you need to change the non-async functions that the api uses to async.
