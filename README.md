## Introduction

Each challenge is based on a code example that you can download at the top. To complete a challenge, read through the challenge text and work on the code to solve the problem. Some challenges might be quite short, others are going to take you a bit more time. You'll also see some challenges work on the same codebase. I've done this on purpose so that on the one hand you will recognize the code sooner so it takes you less time to get into the material, and reusing code also made it easier for me to create more complex challenges.

## Challenges

### Day 1: KISS
Count the frequency of each type of fruit and return a dictionary where the keys are the names of the fruits and the values are their respective counts. Write a Python function named count_fruits that accomplishes this task in the simplest possible way. Follow the KISS principle to avoid unnecessary complexity in your solution.

After completing the function, write tests to ensure that it's working correctly. You can use Python's built-in unittest package for this, or you can simply add a couple of assertions to the main function.

After you've completed the tasks, reflect on your solution and ask yourself the following questions:

* Is your solution as simple as it could be, or is there a simpler approach?
* Does your solution use language features and constructs appropriately and effectively?

### Day 2: Type Annotations
Type annotations in Python allow you to explicitly specify the data types of constants, variables, function parameters and return values. This helps to improve code clarity, readability, and maintainability, especially in large-scale projects where multiple developers may be working on the same codebase.

By using type annotations, you can catch potential bugs early on in the development process, and on top of that they help your IDE provide better code suggestions and error detection.

For this challenge, you will need to add type annotations to the code given in the `type_annotations\before.py`. Before you start working on the code, make sure your VS Code editor has the Python language extension installed and also make sure that you've set type checking mode to "strict". You can do this by adding the following line to your settings.json file:

```
"python.analysis.typeCheckingMode": "strict"
```

Once you've done that and you open `type_annotations\before.py`, you should see a bunch of errors related to the types missing (even though you can still run the code).

The challenge is to write the type annotations so that:

* All type errors identified by the IDE are gone
* The type annotations are a generic as possible - in other words, the type annotations shouldn't impose any extra limitations on how you can use the functions

You're not allowed to use the Any type in this challenge. You can make minor modifications to the code if needed. However, the functionality should stay the same and you're not allowed to change things like function arguments and return types.

### Day 3: Decoupling
In this challenge, you're going to work on a banking service.

The problem with the current code is that the `BankService` class in `bank.py` is highly coupled with the payment service and the different account types. Also, the code has quite a bit of duplication. Your job is to refactor this code so that it's less coupled and has less duplicate code.

You have quite a bit of freedom in this challenge: it's okay to introduce new classes or replace existing classes by functions, feel free to experiment! However, the goal remains that banking operations should be decoupled from payment operations as much as possible.

### Day 4: DRY
The Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) principle is a coding principle that aims to reduce repetition in code. It suggests that when writing code, you should avoid duplicating code logic or functionality in multiple places, and instead, create reusable code elements that can be called and reused throughout your codebase.

There are at least 3 places where there's a lot of code repetition. The challenge is to identify these places and refactor the code so that the repetition is removed.

#### Resources
* [DRY principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself) (Wikipedia)
  
### Day 5: String Formatting

String formatting is a way of constructing a string that includes dynamic or variable values. It allows you to insert values into a string and control how those values are displayed. You can use string formatting to replace placeholders in a string with actual values, such as numbers or strings, and also specify how those values should be formatted.

This can help make your code more readable and easier to maintain, especially when you need to output complex or formatted strings. In Python, there are different ways to perform string formatting, including using the % operator, the format() method, or f-strings. 

The starting point of this challenge is a code example that creates a shopping cart and prints an overview of the shopping cart contents to the console. Currently, this is what the program produces, which is unfortunately quite hard to read:

```
Shopping Cart:
Item, Price, Qty, Total
Apple, 1.50, 10, 15.00
Banana, 2.00, 2, 4.00
Pizza, 11.90, 5, 59.50
========================================
Total: $78.50
```
The goal is to use string formatting to make the output easier to read by better aligning the values. Ultimately, the table look something like this:
```
Shopping Cart:
Item           Price    Qty        Total
Apple       $   1.50     10     $  15.00
Banana      $   2.00      2     $   4.00
Pizza       $  11.90      5     $  59.50
========================================
Total: $ 78.50
```

The exact number of spaces between each column is not important. However, the dollar signs as well as the prices need to be correctly aligned.

### Day 6: Demeter
The Law of Demeter, also known as the Principle of Least Knowledge, is a software design guideline that suggests that an object should avoid direct interaction with other objects that are not directly related to its primary purpose.

In simpler words, this law states that an object should only communicate with its immediate friends and not with the friends/attributes of its friends. Violating this principle can result in tightly coupled and brittle code that is difficult to maintain and modify over time.

A typical violation of the law is that one object directly interacts with an instance variable of another object. The code belonging to this challenge has several violations of the Law of Demeter. Refactor the code to remove these violations.

#### Resources
* [Law of Demeter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_Demeter) (Wikipedia)

### Day 7: Better Discounts
A new feature has been added to the shopping cart system: discounts!

Unfortunately, the developer who coded this (let's call him "Arjan"), didn't do a very good job! He used inheritance to add the discount feature and set things up in such a way that the discount codes and discount handling is all hardcoded in a single method.

You've been hired to redesign the discounts system so that it's easier to add new discount codes on the fly and simplify the code. Feel free to change anything you like in the code, but make sure there's still a ShoppingCart class since that's what the customer needs to integrate into their webshop.

### Day 8: Payment Strategy
The Strategy pattern is a design pattern that allows you to define a family of algorithms (strategies) and make them interchangeable within an object at runtime. In other words, it lets you define a set of related algorithms and encapsulate each one in a separate class.

An object can then use one of these algorithms (strategies) without knowing the details of how the algorithm works or how it's implemented. This pattern promotes the principle of "composition over inheritance", which means that behavior should be composed dynamically at runtime rather than being hard-coded into classes through inheritance. This makes the code more flexible, extensible, and easy to maintain.

The example code allows you to pay by credit card, PayPal or Apple Pay. This is handled by the `process_payment` method in the ShoppingCart class. In this version of the code though, the shopping cart and in particular the `process_payment` method needs to know all the implementation details of each payment processing option. 

For this challenge you need to refactor this code and use the Strategy pattern to remove the coupling between the shopping cart and the different payment methods. You don't have to follow the pattern exactly by the book, you can also use a variety of the pattern, as long as it accurately removes the coupling.

* [Strategy design pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy_pattern) (Wikipedia)

### Day 9: Plugins
In this challenge, we're going to take the Strategy pattern you implemented in the previous challenge to the next level.

When you take a look at the code, you see that at the moment, adding a new payment processor means we have to change the application code. For example, if you wanted to add a Google Pay option, you'll need to add a function to the main.py file. This is not ideal, because that file will get larger and larger as you add more payment methods. Additionally, it would be ideal if adding a new payment method requires only minimal changes in the rest of the code so that things are nicely decoupled and it's really easy to extend the code in the future.

The aim of this challenge is to modify the code so that we can add additional payment methods without having to change anything at all in the main file. This is what's also called a plugin mechanism.

Modify the code so that you can add more payment methods by going through these simple steps:

* Create a new Python script containing the code for the payment method that you'd like to add.
* Put the script in a dedicated plugins folder.
* Now run main.py - it should recognize the new payment method in the plugins folder and make it available automatically to the user.

Once you've refactored the code so that it supports a plugin interface, test it by creating a new payment method and verify that you can use it without having to change anything in the rest of the code.

<summary>Hints</summary>

* You can use importlib to dynamically load Python scripts and you can use os.walk to retrieve the files in a particular folder.
* Feel free to split things up into separate files. For example, you could create a separate file that manages loading and getting access to the plugins, so your main.py file remains relatively small.

### Day 10: OO to Functional

The debate over functional vs object-oriented programming has been ongoing for decades, and both paradigms have their proponents and detractors. At a high level, object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that models real-world objects and their relationships, while functional programming (FP) is a programming paradigm that focuses on the evaluation of functions and their application to data.

Even though I'm using more and more concepts from the functional paradigm in my own projects, I find that in some cases an object-oriented approach is a better solution. Fortunately for us, Python supports both object-oriented and functional programming!

This challenge is aimed at helping you understand the difference between object-oriented (OO) programming and functional programming. As you can see, the code has been setup as an object-oriented program. There are various Shape classes as well as a ShapeCalculator class.

Change the code to follow a functional coding style. Make sure the refactored code has the following properties:

* There are zero classes in the new version of the code, you're only allowed to use functions.
* There are zero variables and variable assignments in the new version of the code - arguments to functions are allowed.

### Day 11: Cohesion
It is very common when coding and especially for beginners that people write very big functions with lots of different functionalities inside. Although this might look very appealing approach because you can write the code faster, it creates unnecessary coupling of functionalities, that becomes a headache later on when you try to test, debug, or further develop your application.

In the code belonging to this challenge, you'll see that there is a single `main()` function that contains everything. Refactor this function into several smaller ones without - of course - affecting the overall functionality. There are many ways in which you can split up the single large function, but try to come up with a solution that makes sure the separate functions are not too large, that they're easy to test, and that there's not too much duplication.

### Day 12: MVP

When you create a GUI application, it's a good thing to consider separating the GUI-specific code such as creating frames, buttons, text fields, and so on, from the logic of your application (what should happen when you press a button), as well as from the data that your application relies on or modifies.

There are different architectural patterns that address this. The most well-known one is Model-View-Controller, but there are several varieties including Model-View-Presenter or Model-View-Viewmodel.

The code that you'll use as a starting point in this challenge has a single `main()` function containing everything, although it does rely on the functions you created in the previous challenge that process data.

Refactor this code by using a GUI architectural pattern such as Model-View-Controller or Model-View-Presenter. Consider:

* What code should be part of each element of the pattern?
* Where should we create and connect the Model, View, and Controller/Presenter objects?
* Which object needs to have a reference to which other object?

### Day 13: Inheritance

I've learned that you should use inheritance sparingly in your code. It can be a really helpful tool to decouple your code, especially if you use inheritance with Abstract Base Classes or Protocols in Python.

Unfortunately, many developers abuse inheritance to do other things than decoupling your code. The code belonging to this challenge is a good example of that.

The code retrieves the weather information from a free-to-use weather API and prints it to the console. To run the code, you'll need to obtain a free API key from the OpenWeather service. That requires creating an account and you automatically receive one after you confirm your e-mail address. To create an account, [follow these instructions](https://openweathermap.org/appid#signup). Note that it might take some few minutes before the API key is activated on their servers.

* After you've created the free account and you have an API key, download the code and replace the key in the code with your API key. Run the code to see what it does.
* Analyze the code, and take a look at how it's organized. In particular, think about how inheritance is being used in the code.
* Refactor the code so that inheritance is no longer used.
* Compare your second version with the original code and consider in what ways the new version is better. How did you remove the inheritance relationship? Did it lead you to change other things as well in the code?

### Day 14: Abstraction

Introducing (levels of) abstraction allows classes to need less knowledge of each other, thus reducing coupling. This makes code more readable, maintainable and understood better both in depth, but also from a higher (conceptual) level.

For this challenge you need to refactor the given code so that the `WeatherService` becomes agnostic to the requests module.

In the current setup, `WeatherService` fetches the current weather forecast of a given city using the OpenWeather API. However, the `WeatherService` class is coupled to the requests library. This makes it hard to change the request module in the future to something else, or to replace it by a mock http request when testing the code.

The challenge is to use abstraction to separate the `WeatherService` class from the requests module.

<details>
<summary>Hints</summary>

You can create a separate `RequestsClient` class that defines a get method for fetching data from an API, and then let the WeatherService depend on an abstraction.

### Day 15: Higher-Order Functions

A higher-order function is a function that takes one or more functions as arguments, and/or returns a function as  its result. In other words, a higher-order function is a function that operates on functions.

Higher-order functions are a key feature of functional programming, which is a programming paradigm that emphasizes the use of functions to perform computations. They enable a more declarative and expressive style of programming, where functions can be composed, combined, and manipulated like any other value.

Some common examples of higher-order functions in Python include map, filter, and reduce. These functions take one or more functions as arguments and apply them to some input data to produce a new output.

The goal of this challenge is to take the object-oriented weather service code from the previous challenge (see the Downloads section at the top) and change it to functional code that relies on a higher-order function, as follows:

* First, turn the `WeatherService` class into separate functions. Specifically, create a `get_forecast` function that takes an `HttpClient`, a city and an API key and then returns the forecast object.
* Turn the properties that retrieve temperature, humidity, etc, into separate functions that get the forecast object as an argument and then extract the relevant information.
* Now, change the `RequestsClient` class into a get function, and then pass that function to the `get_forecast` function (this turns it into a higher-order function!)

As a bonus, can you define another function that allows you to get a weather forecast without having to provide the http getter function and the API key?

* [Functools in Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ph2HjBQuI8Y) (Video)

### Day 16: Configuration

A configuration file allows you to store settings or parameters separately from the code. This makes it easier to  modify or manage these settings without changing the code itself, and also allows you to use the same code with different configurations, easier than when you need to find that value in the code itself.

In the weather service example, specifically the API url and the API key are things that are good candidates to move to a config file.

Extend so the information is now read from a config file (in JSON format). Consider the following things while refactoring the code:

* What values should we store in the config file and how do we structure it?
* Where do we define the config file path?
* Where should be load the config file?
* How should we pass data that is read from the config file to the code that needs it?

### Day 17: Concurrency

Using coroutines and the async/await syntax makes it easy to write concurrent code, which is code that can perform multiple tasks concurrently without blocking the execution of other code. Concurrent code is especially useful for applications that perform I/O-bound operations that the application needs to wait on.

I've extended the weather service application to now automatically provide the current weather for the capital cities of a number of countries. It relies on another free API to retrieve the capital of a country first, and then it retrieves the weather information.

Currently, the application doesn't use concurrent programming at the moment. When you run the code (make sure to insert your OpenWeather API key first!), you'll see that it actually runs quite slowly. The challenge is to refactor this code so it relies on concurrency to make it respond faster. Use the asyncio module together with async and await. There are a few different ways in which you can structure the API calls, but only one of them is optimal!

Note that for this challenge, you don't need to worry about rate limits, even though that is a nice bonus to consider if you want to dive in deeper.

### Day 18: Refactoring

While running code directly from its script is quite common, especially when developing, sometimes it's (necessary or) useful to run the application through the command line. This simplifies the interface for the user and allows for extra functionality such as documentation for all the available commands and examples of how to use the interface.

I have (again) extended the weather service application to now include a command-line interface. Refactor the command-line interface code in the main.py file to solve these design problems:

* There's a lot of duplication in the CLI code.
* Everything is in a single main function.
* Translating the CLI to display another language (for example, Dutch instead of English) would be a nightmare.

### Day 19: Itertools
Python has excellent built in libraries that can simplify many process without you having to re-invent the wheel every time. A great example of this is the itertools package. This has many functionalities for iterating over lists or any other iterable object and performing a variety of operations on the data.

In the code for this challenge, a random list of persons is created. Then, the list of the persons is filtered by age. Finally, a summary is printed that groups the persons by country and shows how many persons live in each country.

Refactor the code in the main function by replacing the for-loops by functions from the itertools package.

### Day 20: Inappropriate Intimacy

In programming, inappropriate intimacy refers to a situation where different parts of code become too dependent on each other, making changes or fixes difficult and causing potential issues. For example, imagine a Python class that directly accesses and modifies variables of another class, instead of using methods to interact with it, or a function that requests a lot of information without actually needing it. This tight coupling creates a brittle system that is hard to maintain and test. Inappropriate intimacy is an example of a code smell: if you see it in a piece of code, it's an indication that you need to fix something in the design.

An example of inappropriate intimacy is in the code for this challenge. Can you detect what it is? Refactor the code to fix the problem.
