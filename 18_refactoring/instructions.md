## Develop code to run the weather app via the command line

While running code directly from its script is quite common, especially when developing, sometimes
its (necessary or) useful to run the application through the command line. This simplified the interface
for the user and allows some extra functionality such as documentation for all the available commands and
examples how to use the interface.

## Challenge

Refactor the command line interface code to solve these design problems:

- There's a lot of duplication
- Everything is in a single main function
- Translating the cli to display another language (for example, Dutch instead of English) would be a nightmare
